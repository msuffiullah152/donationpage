        <p id="story">Brian Fay, Army veteran

            While serving in Afghanistan as a medic, I was injured and had to be evacuated to Germany and eventually medically retired. PTSD started to sink in after I left the Army as my op tempo was so high and suddenly stopped. That is when the dust settles for combat vets.
            
            I struggled with losing sleep, flashbacks, and the effects of being overmedicated by doctors. I didnâ€™t find any relief when I visited a VA psychiatrist. I felt like the doctor I saw was searching for stories and asking questions that put me more on edge than helped me heal.
            
            But I was lucky enough to find nonprofit counseling services that helped me turn things around. I was advised to find something that I could pour my energy into and make my own. I took up writing and other creative ventures, found ways to channel those outlets into a purpose I felt I was missing after serving, namely helping others.
            
            My advice to other veterans who are struggling with PTSD is to find the healthy outlets and support you need to move forward. I feel way better than I did at the beginning of my journey, and that is possible for anyone else.</p>
